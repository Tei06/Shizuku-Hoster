# Shizuku-Hoster
this was coded when I first started out with programming, much of the code is a mess and doesn't make sense
I was experimenting with discord bots as well as MongoDB, adding random functions that were funny.
this bot got my friends and I some good laughs. 


code is outdated; running off an old version of discord.py
